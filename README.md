# Triangle Area Calculator
#### Video Demo: https://gigishengelia1.github.io/triangle-area-calculator/
#### Description:

The **Triangle Area Calculator** is a web-based tool designed to help users calculate the area of a triangle using three different methods. The tool is user-friendly and provides three input options for calculating the area, making it versatile for various triangle properties.

### Features:
1. **Input Methods**: The calculator supports three different ways of calculating the area of a triangle:
   - Two sides and the included angle (using the formula \( \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C) \)).
   - Three sides using Heron's formula.
   - Two angles and the included side (using the ASA method).

2. **Dynamic Forms**: Based on the userâ€™s selection, the form dynamically changes to show the appropriate input fields, making the user experience intuitive and seamless.

3. **Validation**: The inputs are validated to ensure that the triangle's sides and angles form a valid triangle. This includes ensuring that angles are within the range (0 < angle < 180 degrees).

4. **Interactive Theme**: The app includes a theme toggle feature, allowing users to switch between light, dark, and gray themes with a simple button click.

5. **Responsive Design**: The design is fully responsive, ensuring that the tool works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout adjustments, including animations for theme changes.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and input validation.

### Purpose:
This project serves as both an educational tool and a practical utility for anyone needing to calculate the area of a triangle. It was developed as part of the CS50 final project to demonstrate proficiency in web development and problem-solving using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to use the **Triangle Area Calculator** to quickly and accurately calculate triangle areas based on your given parameters. Whether you're studying geometry, working on engineering problems, or just in need of a quick calculation, this tool can help simplify your process.

### Installation:
To use the Triangle Area Calculator, simply clone this repository or download the files to your local machine or go to link https://gigishengelia1.github.io/triangle-area-calculator/

### Future Improvements:
- Add support for additional triangle area calculation methods.
- Provide error messages and tips when invalid input is detected.
- Enhance the UI/UX for a more polished design.
